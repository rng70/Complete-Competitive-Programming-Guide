<h1>Bit Trick</h1>

---

**This file contains some trick using bitwise operation. It’s my a little effort to collect them and put then in one file**



1. ***Turn of Rightmost Contiguous string of set-Bits:***

   Use the following formula to turn off the rightmost contiguous string of 1-bits (e.g. 01011000 –> 01000000)![u \atop \text{>>}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=u%20%5Catop%20%5Ctext%7B%3E%3E%7D)

   1. **Formula:**

      * **(((x | (x - 1)) + 1) & x)**

   2. **Formula:**

      * **(((x & -x) + x) & x)**

        

2. ***Average of Two Integers:***

   1. The following formula may be used to compute the average of two unsigned integers, ![\lfloor \frac{x+y}{2} \rfloor](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Clfloor%20%5Cfrac%7Bx%2By%7D%7B2%7D%20%5Crfloor) without causing overflow

      * **Formula:**
        * **(x & y) + ((x ![\oplus](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Coplus)y) ![u \atop \text{>>}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=u%20%5Catop%20%5Ctext%7B%3E%3E%7D) 1)**

   2. The formula below computes ![\lceil \frac{x+y}{2} \rceil ](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Clceil%20%5Cfrac%7Bx%2By%7D%7B2%7D%20%5Crceil%20) without causing overflow

      * **Formula:**
        * **(x | y) - ((x ![\oplus](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Coplus)y) ![u \atop \text{>>}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=u%20%5Catop%20%5Ctext%7B%3E%3E%7D) 1)**

      To compute the same quantities (“floor and ceiling averages”) for signed
      integers, use the same formulas but with the unsigned shift replaced with a signed
      shift.

      

3. **Next higher number with same set-Bits:**

   Given a number ***m*** and find the next smallest higher number ***r*** that has the same set bits.

   .i.e 

   ​			3 (0000011) => 5(0000101)
   ​			6(0000110) => 9(0001001)
   ​			11(0001011) => 13(0001101) 

   1. Observation:

      * 0000011 ==> 0000 <=…=> 011 (3) 

        ​							to 

      * 0000101 ==> 0000 <=…=> 101 (5)

   2. Observation:

      Now lets just look at what changed

      * 011 	   =>  101
      * 0110	  =>  1001
      * 011        =>  101
      * 0111      =>  1011
      * 011000 =>  100001
      * 01100   =>  10001
      * 01110   =>  10011

   3. Observation:

      * Before conversion:
        * 0 followed by
        * One or more 1’s (say x) followed by
        * Zero or more 0’s (say y)
      * After conversion:
        * 1 followed by
        * (y+1) zeros followed by
        * (x-1) 1’s

      **Algorithm:**

      * Given a bit-pattern, start from right, find successive zeroes
        (xxxx011110000)
      * Followed by zeroes find successive 1’s (xxxx011110000)
      * Stop on hitting a zero (xxxx011110000)
      * Interchange that zero with a 1 from successive 1’s
        (xxxx101110000)
      * Now move the remaining 1’s to extreme right, filling the
        gap with zeroes (xxxx100000111)

      **Code Segment**

      ```c++
      unsigned xchange(unsigned x){
          // given x value
          // for this purpose assume x = 1111 0000 (240)
          
          // wrape up all trailing zeros followed by one 1 bit
          smallest = x & -x; 
          // now smallest = 0001 0000
          
          // shift leftmost '1' to one position left
          ripple = x + smallest;
          // now ripple = 1 0000 0000
          
          // restoring all consecutive 1's of original bit stream
          ones = x ^ ripple;
          //ones = 1 1111 0000
          
          // make a bit stream with (x-1) 1's
          ones = (ones >> 2)/smallest;
          // ones = 0000 0111
          
          return ripple|ones;
          // returning 1 0000 0111
      }
      ```



4. ***Check even or odd:***

   To check even or odd it can easily be checked by `&` operator

   Now we will check a pattern first. We will take some integer and check their bits.

   

   Odds:  

   In decimal                            Binary

   3                                            0011

   5                                            0101

   7                                            0111

   now every odd numbers ends with a set bit.

   Evens;

   In decimal                            Binary

   2                                            0010

   4                                            0100

   6                                            0110

   here, every even numbers ends with a bit `0`.

   So we can check the bit and make the decision

   ```c++
   void evenOdd(int n){
       // checking if the LSB is a set bit 
       if(n&1){
           cout << n << " is a Odd number" << endl;
       }else{
           cout << n << " is a Even number" << endl;
       }
   }
   ```

5. ***Detect if two integers have opposite signs:***

   The expression `x^y` is negative if `x` and `y` have opposite signs.

   Here is the facts why?

   we know the leftmost bit of a positive number is `0` and the negative number is `1`. 

   Now we know `xor` of `0` and `1` is 1 so, if the numbers are opposite then `xor` of the two numbers will contain set bit as MSB. So, it will be a negative number. But if the numbers have same sign then they will contain `0` as MSB so result will be positive.

   .i.e.

   00000100 (4) ^ 00001000 (8) = 00001100 (12)

   00000100 (4) ^ 11111000 (-8) = 11111100 

   code segment:

   ```c++
   void checkSigns(int x, int y){
       if(x^y >0){
           cout << x << " and " << y << " both have same sign" << endl;
       }else{
           cout << x << " and " << y << " have different signs" << endl;
       }
   }
   ```

6. ***Add 1 to a given integer:***

   The expression ``-~x` will add to `1` with a given integer `x`.

   We know that to get negative of a number, we will invert its bits and add 1 to it(2’s complement).

   ```
   -x = ~x +1;
   So, -~x = x + 1;
   ```

   Code segment(C++):

   ```c++
   int addOne(int x){
       return -~x;
   }
   ```

7. ***Swap two numbers without using any third variable:***

   You will find it amazing. 

   The idea is to use `XOR` operation for swapping two numbers by their property that `x^x=0` 

   .i.e.

   Two numbers `a` and `b` 

   ```c++
   a = a ^ b;
   b = a ^ b;
   // here a contains a ^ b
   // so b = a ^ b will do something like b = (a ^ b) ^ b;
   // thus b will contains a
   a = a ^ b;
   // here a contains a ^ b and b contains a
   // so, basically a contains (a ^ b) ^ a thus b
   Thus numbers are swaped
   ```

   We will do some additional check if the numbers are same or not.

   Code segment(C++):

   ```c++
   void swapNumbers(int &x, int &y){
       if(x!=y){
           x = x ^ y;
           y = x ^ y;
           x = x ^ y;
       }
   }
   ```

8. ***Turn off k<sup>th</sup> bit in a number:***

   The idea is to use bitwise `<<`, `&` and `~` operators. By using expression `~(1 << (k-1))` we get a number which has all its bits set, except the k<sup>th</sup> bit. If we do a bitwise `AND` of the expression with `n` i.e. `(n & (~(1 << (k-1))))`, we get a number which has all bits same as `n` except the k<sup>th</sup> bit which will be set to `0`. 

   Code segment(C++):

   ````c++
   void turnOffKthBit(int &n){
       return n & (~(1 << (k-1)));
   }
   ````

9. ***Turn on k<sup>th</sup> bit in a number:***

   The idea is to use bitwise `<<` and `|` operators. By using expression `(1 << (k-1))` we get a number which has all its bits `0`, except the k<sup>th</sup> bit. If we do a bitwise `OR`  of the expression with `n` i.e. `(n | (1 << (k-1)))`, we get a number which has all bits same as `n` except the k<sup>th</sup> bit which will be set to `1`. 

   Code segment(C++):

   ```c++
   void turnOnKthBit(int n){
       return n | (1 << (k-1));
   }
   ```
