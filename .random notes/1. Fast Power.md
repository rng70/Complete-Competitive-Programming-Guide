​		There are several cases when we need to calculate ![a^b (\mod p) ](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=a%5Eb%20(%5Cmod%20p)%20)

 Sometimes this is called `big Mod` or sometimes it is called `fast power`. 

This can be easily implemented using the following code:

``` c++
auto pow(auto a, auto b, auto p)
	{ 
		auto ans = 1; 
		for(auto i = 0; i < b; ++i) 
			{ 
				ans *= a;
				ans %= p; 
			} 
		return ans; 
	}
```

This is not so much efficient when we consider time-complexity to calculate this. Definitely we can get correct answer but this can be too much time consuming when b is so large.

In this case, there is a way to compute  ![a^b (\mod p) ](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=a%5Eb%20(%5Cmod%20p)%20) efficiently using binary exponentiation.



How we can calculate a<sup>b</sup> if b is even and also if b is odd?

`What if b is even?`

We can calculate ![(a^\frac{b}{2})^2](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(a%5E%5Cfrac%7Bb%7D%7B2%7D)%5E2), here we need to calculate only ![a^\frac{b}{2}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=a%5E%5Cfrac%7Bb%7D%7B2%7D) and then we can use same answer to get the final answer.
		`What if b is odd?`
	We can calculate ![b = b^\prime + 1](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=b%20%3D%20b%5E%5Cprime%20%2B%201) where ![b^\prime](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=b%5E%5Cprime) is even and now  a<sup>b</sup> = a<sup>b<sup>‘</sup>+1</sup> = a<sup>b<sup>‘</sup></sup>. a where b<sup>\prime</sup> is even and thus we can solve it using first 
	method when b is even. That’s it.

Implementation is too straightforward using recursion.

```c++
auto pow(auto a, auto b, auto p)
	{ 
		if(b == 0) 
			return 1; 
		auto ans = pow(a, b/2, p); 
		(ans *= ans) % p; 
		if(b&1) 
			(ans *= a) % p; 
		return ans; 
	}

```

Iterative implementation is not much complicated.

```c++
auto pow(auto a, auto b, auto p)
	{
		auto ans = 1LL; 
		while(b) 
		{
			 if(b % 2 == 1)
				 (ans *= a) %= p; 
			a = (auto)a * a % p;
			b /= 2; 
		} 
		return ans; 
	}

```

Complexity : ![\Theta(\log_2 N)](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5CTheta(%5Clog_2%20N)) 

This method is known  as 'Half-Splitting Principle' which has many other uses.
