# Programming Resources

 This repository contains books, useful links, awesome courses and other materials for programmers (competitive and developer both). This is just a collection of some books, slides, blogs & website links. I am just trying to keep all resources in one place to access easily. May be it will help you too :)

# Read It First

---

1. You may wonder that why I'm keeping books on GitHub instead of drive because it's easy to maintain
2. I have just put my all collections in one place and I have collected all the documents from online so as I have found them on online so I strongly believe that they are shareable. So I think no copyright issue will arise to do a simple collections sharing.

2. If you have a collection to then please share or send a pull request to help others.

3. **some quality issue**

    May be some resources are not too much good to read but well enough to read I think. May be it is the issue of file compression. So happy reading.

## Programming:

### Competitive:

[Contest-Archive](https://csacademy.com/contest/archive/ "https://csacademy.com/contest/archive/")

[HAlexV - Competitive Programming Resources](https://halexv.blogspot.com/2015/10/competitive-programming-resources.html "https://halexv.blogspot.com/2015/10/competitive-programming-resources.html") and [BlogPosts](https://halexv.blogspot.com/)

1. Online Judges(Practice):

   1. [a2oj.com problem category](https://www.a2oj.com/Categories.html "https://www.a2oj.com/Categories.html") This is a list of category of problems that are needed to implement most often.

      

      Here is some cool online judge lists. You will not only be able to solve problems but also you will find a lot of tutorials, articles and other materials.

      1. [P3G Online Judge](https://wcipeg.com/main "https://wcipeg.com/main") This is more than a online judge. You will find their wiki(http://wcipeg.com/wiki/Main_Page) more useful than their problems.
