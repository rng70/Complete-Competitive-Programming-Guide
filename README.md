# some Resources for Competitive Programming
 This repository contains some books and other material for competitive programmer. Not for competitive programmers but for all programmers. This is just a collection of some books, slides, blogs & website links. I have just tried to keep some resources in one place. It can be helpful for programmers. May be :)
# some comments 
 I have just put my all collections in one folder and I have collected all the documents from online so as I have found them on online so I strongly believe that they are shareable. So I think no copyright issue will arise to do a simple collections sharing.
# some quality issue 
 May be some resources are not too much good to read but well enough to read I think. May be it is the issue of file compression. So happpy reading.
