# Programming Resources

 This repository contains books, useful links, awesome courses, and other materials for programmers (competitive and developer both). This is just a collection of some books, slides, blogs & website links. I am just trying to keep all resources in one place to access easily. Maybe it will help you too 😄

---

<h1>Read It First</h1>

---

1. You may wonder that why I'm keeping books on GitHub instead of drive because it's easy to maintain

2. I have just put my all collections in one place and I have collected all the documents from online so as I have found them on online so I strongly believe that they are shareable. So I think no copyright issue will arise to do a simple collections sharing.

3. If you have a collection to then please share or send a pull request to help others.

4. ### Some Quality Issue
   
    May be some resources are not too much good to read but well enough to read I think. May be it is the issue of file compression. So happy reading.
